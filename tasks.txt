[ ] install babel locally
[ ] install babel-cli locally, which should install babel-node, try to run everything locally
[ ] should be able to run babel with nodemon, which will restart the api server automatically
    [ ] see if debug will work
[ ] setup ES6 as a separate task, not worthed to get it running with nodemon
[ ] setup api first, with test api, then deploy to heroku


Tasks
[] Make sure you are running the LTS version of Node.js (as of October 2016 the LTS version was v4.6.0)

[] Create package.json
    $ npm init

[] Install babel-node
    $ npm install babel-cli --save

[] Enable babel presets, create .babelrc file and add presets:
    {
      "presets": ["es2015", "react"]
    }

[] Add /node_modules and /dist to .gitignore

Let's test the babel setup.

[] create src/test.js with code:
    let list = [1,2,3];

    for (let number of list) {
    	console.log(number);
    }

    console.log(...list);

[] setup babel in package.json:
    "scripts": {
        "build": "babel src -d dist"
      }

[] build it:
    $ npm run build

[] test it
    $ node dist/test.js
    $ node src/test.js
